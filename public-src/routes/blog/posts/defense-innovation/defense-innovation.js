				It was a helpless feeling, made all the worse by the fact I had done everything I could think of to stop Trump from winning. I marched for Black Lives Matter and I checked-in at Standing Rock Reservation. I caucused for Bernie Sanders and even donated to him, the first time I had ever given money to a politician. When he lost, I voted for Hillary Clinton; even if she wasn’t the candidate the country needed, ANYONE would have been better than an out-of-touch billionaire spouting xenophobic, racist, and sexist slurs. In the end though, none of it mattered. He still won, and I felt like America lost more than an election. I felt like America lost its soul.
				</p>
				<p>
				I lost a lot of faith in this country that night, not just in its government but also in its people. Through all the insanity and tragedy of the last few years, I still had some hope that the American people would do the right thing and come together to prevent a Trump presidency. Against overwhelming evidence to the contrary, I still believed in the American ideals of equality and liberty. I believed that the American people valued justice over tyranny, freedom over hate, truth over slander, and opportunity over oppression. But a Trump victory said otherwise, and it was clear that the values I felt were so obvious and so enshrined in the idea of America were not shared by a major percentage of the American electorate, or at least not as valued as I had thought. I had already lost trust in the American government, but without trust in its people, there was no where else and no one else to turn to. If the American people couldn’t change things, who could?

				It was while entertaining such questions that I found myself at the <a href="http://www.defenseinnovation.us/">Defense Innovation Summit</a> in Austin, Texas last week. Truth be told, I was not excited about going; if it hadn’t been for my job, I would never have gone. The thought of standing around at a conference full of employees of the Department of Defense and war-profiteering defense contractors giddy with excitement over their increased budget with the incoming administration made my stomach churn. I imagined everyone clinking glasses and celebrating new shipments of bullets and bombs while humming “Hail to the Chief.” The bleeding-heart libertarian inside me silently raged while externally I was resigned to a front row seat to one of the first overtures of the fall of Rome.
				</p>
				<p>
				Then I got to the conference, and what I learned there surprised me.
				</p>
				<p>
				Many of those in attendance at the conference live and work in D.C. and they described November 9th 2016 in Washington as many in New York described September 12th 2001: quiet, as if the nation were in mourning. At the conference, Trump’s victory was the elephant in the room that some joked about, others vaguely referenced, and most avoided in discussion. The keynote speeches and the panel discussions were colored with an air of uncertainty, and though some hazarded guesses as to what the future might hold under a President Trump, many more had no clue. Still, some things were certain: many people would be out of a job come January (and possibly more than just those with appointed positions, as suggested by the incoming administration’s recent survey sent to employees of the Department of Energy), and the much-needed funding that fueled federal innovation and technology would be redirected, reallocated, and reassigned. What that meant for the country, its people, its soldiers, and its interests around the globe, no one could say for sure. The line between us and them, the government and the rest of us, blurred, and it was clear how everyone, even those at the top, would be affected come January 20th.
				</p>
				<p>
				Despite the presence of such political undertones, the overall theme of the conference was primarily focused on innovation as well as collaboration between government and private industry. The DoD was the 800 pound gorilla in the room, yes, and a lot of the discussions centered around technology meant for soldiers in combat (when you consider the number of consumer technologies that were developed with defense spending, this seems less ominous), but many addressed energy inefficiency and improved infrastructure as well as advances in healthcare, emergency response, and climate change. Federal employees and military personnel spoke directly with researchers and entrepreneurs and discussed the innovation needs of the country, not just for today but for decades into the future, signing contracts and collaborating to develop and implement new technologies. The gridlock we see in government today was completely absent; everyone was working together to make progress happen.
				</p>
				<p>
				I’m not naive enough to say that the federal R&D space is completely devoid of corruption, because it clearly isn’t. Cronyism, nepotism, sexism, and many other -isms were definitely at play at this conference, and there were some people thrilled to death at the prospect of the incoming administration and what increased defense spending would do to their bottom-line. Despite that, my main takeaway from the conversations I had and discussions I listened to was a renewed sense of hope for the future of this country. While the rest of nation has been bitterly divided by polarizing political lines, many of the folks at the conference were openly and proudly nonpartisan; it doesn’t make sense to play party politics when the presidential pendulum swings back and forth every 4–8 years, and doing so would be bad for business. Rather than waste time arguing over candidates or the thirty-some talking points repeated endlessly on network media, these people were there to get things done, to drive technological change, and make things better.
				</p>
				<p>
				Throughout the conference, the power of collaboration was palpable, challenging the unilateral approaches to problem-solving I was used to seeing from both government as well as industry. Stranger still were the invitations some folks issued to have their opinions challenged, opening the floor to anyone who saw policies or priorities differently to start a conversation with decision-makers. I was struck by that respect for discourse, and it made me wonder how different the discussions happening presently in this country if the partisan elements were removed and people focused instead on solutions to a problem. Rather than defending or demonizing Obamacare, maybe instead we can focus on affordable healthcare that works for everyone regardless of income or background. Instead of building a wall, maybe we can bring problem-solvers together to ensure fair and ethical treatment of illegal immigrants. These problems and many more can and are being solved effectively and agilely through technological innovations developed in partnerships between industry leaders and government representatives, rather than argued <i>ad nauseam</i> in Congressional debates and over 24-hour news cycles.
				</p>
				<p>
				This approach to problem-solving, developing innovative solutions to real-world problems and then collaborating to implement them, seems so obvious, but prior to the conference in Austin, I wasn’t sure it was possible any more in America, but I count myself lucky in that I got to witness it firsthand. I still read the daily news with a wary eye, and I look to the looming inauguration with a healthy but no less hefty amount of trepidation; as of yet, there’s not much technological innovation can do to prevent cabinet appointments or policy changes that threaten civilian liberties or national security, let alone errant tweets that affect the stock price of major companies. Still, I rest a little easier at night knowing that there are people in this country tirelessly working to solve problems, and though legislation and policy can hamper progress, it can never stop it completely. The American spirit is alive and well, and progress is, as it always has been, in the hands of the people.
